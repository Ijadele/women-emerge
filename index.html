                    <p>
                        According to the world bank, 80 million people will loose their job between now and 2030, meanwhile, current unemployment rate is alarming and women folk are at the receiving end.
                        It may please you to know that 26.6% of women willing to work are unemployed.
                        25.9% of employed women are underemployed and some fear being laid off.
                        The average African-Nigerian lady sits in a position of systematic disadvantage & inferiority complex, prone to abuse of different kind as a result of not being financially independent.
